### 1,2. Tables 
C# DataTable class represents a data table in C#. ... The DataTable class in C# ADO.NET is a database table representation and provides a collection of columns and rows to store data in a grid form. The code sample in this artilce explains how to create a DataTable at run-time in C#.

### 3. Overloading constructors 
Overloaded constructors essentially have the same name (name of the class) and different number of arguments. A constructor is called depending upon the number and type of arguments passed. While creating the object, arguments must be passed to let compiler know, which constructor needs to be called.

### 4. Exceptions
Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another. C# exception handling is built upon four keywords: try, catch, finally, and throw. ... finally − The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements, whether an exception is thrown or not thrown.

### 5. Standart input-output
Input and outputs methods allow to read user input data and show output text.

### 6. Palindromes 
A palindrome number is a number that is same after reverse. For example 121, 34543, 343, 131, 48984 are the palindrome numbers.

### 7. Directory info / File info
C# DirectoryInfo class provides functionality to work with folders or directories. This article will explain the DirectoryInfo class and its usage with C# code examples. The DirectoryInfo class is declared in the System.IO namespace that must be imported before you can use this class.

The FileInfo class provides the same functionality as the static File class but you have more control on read/write operations on files by writing code manually for reading or writing bytes from a file.

### 8. Streams 
A stream is an object used to transfer data. There is a generic stream class System.IO.Stream, from which all other stream classes in .NET are derived. The Stream class deals with bytes.

### 9. Access modifying 
Access modifiers in C# are used to specify the scope of accessibility of a member of a class or type of the class itself. For example, a public class is accessible to everyone without any restrictions, while an internal class may be accessible to the assembly only

### 10. Abstarction 
Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).

The abstract keyword is used for classes and methods.

### 11/12. Nested Classes
A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Basically, a class combines the fields and methods (member function which defines actions) into a single unit. In C#, a user is allowed to define a class within another class. Such types of classes are known as nested class. This feature enables the user to logically group classes that are only used in one place, thus this increases the use of encapsulation, and create more readable and maintainable code.

### 13. Generic Types
Generic means the general form, not specific. In C#, generic means not specific to a particular data type.

C# allows you to define generic classes, interfaces, abstract classes, fields, methods, static methods, properties, events, delegates, and operators using the type parameter and without the specific data type. A type parameter is a placeholder for a particular type specified when creating an instance of the generic type.

A generic type is declared by specifying a type parameter in an angle brackets after a type name, e.g. TypeName<T> where T is a type parameter.

### 14. Delegates 
C# delegates are similar to pointers to functions, in C or C++. A delegate is a reference type variable that holds the reference to a method. The reference can be changed at runtime. Delegates are especially used for implementing events and the call-back methods. All delegates are implicitly derived from the System.

### 15. Collections
Collection classes are specialized classes for data storage and retrieval. These classes provide support for stacks, queues, lists, and hash tables. Most collection classes implement the same interfaces.
